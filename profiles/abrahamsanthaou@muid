### About Me
I’m a passionate and curious coder with a strong interest in building smart, efficient, and user-friendly applications. I love solving real-world problems with code, and I’m constantly looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills. My journey began with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and has grown to include experience with modern tools and frameworks like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React.

Whether it’s designing a responsive front end or working with APIs and databases on the back end, I enjoy every part of the development process. I believe in clean code, strong logic, and writing programs that not only work but also scale well.

I'm always experimenting with personal projects — from web apps to automation scripts — and enjoy collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. I’m also committed to continuous learning, whether it’s through open-source contributions, coding challenges, or online courses.

As a coder, I value creativity, problem-solving, and persistence. My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer who builds impactful, reliable, and meaningful software. I’m excited about what the future holds and the opportunities that code can create.

#### Leadership and Influence:

I meet the requirements for being a leader and influencer in my domain through consistent initiative, collaboration, and a willingness to help others grow. As a coder, I’ve led several small team projects, where I not only contributed technically but also coordinated tasks, ensured deadlines were met, and helped resolve blockers by mentoring peers. For example, during a recent group hackathon, I took charge of backend development and also guided the front-end team to integrate APIs smoothly. Our project was recognized for its functionality and teamwork.

Beyond projects, I actively share my knowledge with fellow learners, whether through tech forums, coding groups, or in person. I’ve helped classmates debug code, understand JavaScript concepts, and build their first websites. My approach is to make complex ideas simple and to encourage others to experiment confidently.

#### Networking:

My networking skills are built on a genuine interest in learning from others and contributing to shared goals. I actively connect with fellow developers through online platforms like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and LinkedIn, where I engage in discussions, contribute to open-source projects, and share insights I’ve gained from personal projects or learning experiences. This has allowed me to form valuable connections with coders from diverse backgrounds and skill levels.

I plan to engage with the wider tech community by participating in hackathons, attending meetups (both online and local), and joining developer groups related to JavaScript, full-stack development, and open source. I also intend to contribute tutorials, blog posts, and code snippets that can help beginners navigate challenges I’ve faced.

#### Career Plan:

Immediate Plans:
My immediate goal is to actively participate in Kerala’s startup ecosystem by collaborating with early-stage startups as a developer and problem solver. I plan to attend local startup events, hackathons, and workshops such as those hosted by Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), TinkerHub, and IEEE. This will help me build strong connections, understand market needs, and identify areas where technology can solve real problems.
Long-Term Plans:
Over the long term, I aspire to launch or join a tech-driven startup that solves a pressing issue in Kerala—be it in education, sustainability, or local commerce. I aim to mentor young coders, build open-source projects that support regional needs, and possibly create a platform where students and startups can collaborate effectively.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

 Kerala has immense potential to become a leading hub in the technology startup ecosystem, thanks to its high literacy rate, strong educational institutions, and growing youth interest in innovation. To truly excel, we need to focus on three key areas: skill development, ecosystem support, and global exposure.

First, there must be a stronger push for hands-on, project-based learning in schools and colleges. Programs like TinkerHub and KSUM’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centres (IEDCs) are already making an impact, but scaling these efforts across all institutions will help nurture a startup mindset from an early age.

Second, Kerala needs to strengthen the bridge between students, professionals, and investors. This can be done by creating more incubation centers outside major cities, streamlining access to startup funding, and encouraging collaborations between academia and industry. Government policies should remain startup-friendly and adaptive to new technologies like AI, blockchain, and clean tech.

Finally, to compete globally, Kerala startups need better exposure to international markets and mentorship. Hosting global tech summits, encouraging remote collaboration, and showcasing success stories will inspire more local talent.

With the right support systems and a culture that embraces experimentation and risk-taking, Kerala can become a national leader in innovation-driven entrepreneurship.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

I strongly believe in the power of open source to drive collaboration, innovation, and learning. I’ve contributed to both personal and community-led open-source projects that reflect real-world problem-solving and team-oriented development.

Personal Projects:
I’ve created and maintained several small open-source projects on GitHub, including a bill-splitting web app built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The project helps groups easily track and split expenses—especially useful for students and roommates. I’ve also built and shared utility scripts in JavaScript and Python for automating tasks like file renaming, basic web scraping, and data formatting.

#### History of Community Engagement:

While I haven’t actively participated in technical communities like Stack Overflow, GitHub Discussions, or Discord forums yet, I’m eager to get involved and contribute meaningfully. So far, my focus has been on learning and building projects on my own, but I now understand the value of community engagement for growth, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

As of now, I haven’t created any technical blog posts, articles, or video content. My current focus has been on learning, building personal projects, and improving my coding skills through practice. However, I recognize the value of sharing knowledge publicly—not only to help others but also to reinforce my own understanding.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:
At this stage in my journey, I haven’t yet developed any software tools that are widely used by external users. Most of my projects have been personal or educational—focused on learning core technologies like JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB through hands-on practice. These include small web apps, utility scripts, and prototypes built to solve simple problems or explore new concepts.

While these tools haven’t reached a public user base yet, they’ve helped me grow significantly as a developer and understand the process of planning, building, testing, and refining real-world applications.
