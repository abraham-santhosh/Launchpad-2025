### About Me
I’m a passionate and curious coder with a strong interest in building smart, efficient, and user-friendly applications. I love solving real-world problems with code, and I’m constantly looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills. My journey began with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and has grown to include experience with modern tools and frameworks like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React.

Whether it’s designing a responsive front end or working with APIs and databases on the back end, I enjoy every part of the development process. I believe in clean code, strong logic, and writing programs that not only work but also scale well.

I'm always experimenting with personal projects — from web apps to automation scripts — and enjoy collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. I’m also committed to continuous learning, whether it’s through open-source contributions, coding challenges, or online courses.

As a coder, I value creativity, problem-solving, and persistence. My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer who builds impactful, reliable, and meaningful software. I’m excited about what the future holds and the opportunities that code can create.
